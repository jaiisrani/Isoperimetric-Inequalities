## Exploring the conjunction of isoperimetric inequalities and optimization algorithms for solving challenging isoperimetric tasks in planar space, graphs, and swarm exploration strategy development.

# The Greedy Algorithm

The Greedy Algorithm is a problem-solving approach that makes locally optimal choices at each step with the hope of finding a global optimum. It is a straightforward, intuitive approach used in various algorithms and heuristics to solve a wide range of problems, including optimization and search problems.

The connection between the Greedy Algorithm and isoperimetric inequalities often arises in problems related to optimization, such as clustering, facility location, or network design. In these problems, you may have a set of points or objects, and you want to find a configuration that optimizes a certain objective function while satisfying some constraints. Isoperimetric inequalities can be used to set constraints on the shapes or regions formed by the objects.
For example, in clustering problems, you may want to group points into clusters while minimizing the total distance between points within each cluster. Isoperimetric inequalities can provide constraints on the shapes of clusters, ensuring that they are not too elongated or irregular in their boundaries.
In this context, the Greedy Algorithm may be used to iteratively form clusters by making locally optimal choices, such as adding points to the nearest cluster, while ensuring that the constraints imposed by isoperimetric inequalities are satisfied.
In this example, we'll distribute points in a 2D plane into clusters while minimizing the total perimeter of the clusters, and we'll use a basic isoperimetric constraint.

(Here, perimeter of a cluster = sum of euclidean distances between all possible pair of points in that cluster)

# The Cheeger Algorithm

The Cheeger constant, named after Jeff Cheeger, is a parameter used to measure the "bottleneck" or narrowest point in a graph or a geometric space. It is defined as the minimum value of a certain ratio, where the numerator represents the number of edges (or measure) crossing a cut in the graph, and the denominator represents the size of the smaller part of the cut. Mathematically, for a graph, it is defined as:

h(G) = min{h(S)} for all non-empty proper subsets S of the vertices of G.

Here, h(S) represents the ratio of edges crossing the cut (i.e., the number of edges connecting vertices in S to vertices outside of S) to the size of the smaller part of the cut. The Cheeger constant provides a measure of how "bottlenecked" a graph is, and it is related to the notion of isoperimetric inequalities, which concern the trade-off between the volume enclosed by a set and its boundary.

In the context of geometric analysis and manifolds, Cheeger's inequality is a fundamental result that relates the eigenvalues of the Laplacian operator to the isoperimetric constant. It provides an upper bound on the eigenvalues of the Laplacian in terms of the isoperimetric constant of the underlying space. This inequality is significant in spectral graph theory, as it connects the spectral properties of a graph to its geometric and topological structure.

Problem: Given a connected undirected graph and a budget constraint, find a subset of nodes that maximizes the Cheeger constant (minimizes the edge cut) while ensuring that the number of nodes in the subset does not exceed the budget.
Solution in Python:
To solve this problem, you can use the NetworkX library to work with graphs and scipy to perform numerical optimizations. First, you'll need to create a graph and define the objective function for optimization, which is to maximize the Cheeger constant.
Refer [this](https://github.com/jaiisrani/Isoperimetric-Optimization-Algorithms/blob/main/Isoperimetric_Inequalities.ipynb) code for the implementation of this algorithm on the example problem.

The code defines an objective function that computes the Cheeger constant for a given subset of nodes, and then uses scipy to maximize this objective function within the budget constraint. The result is the optimal subset of nodes that maximizes the Cheeger constant while satisfying the budget constraint

Some concepts from Graph Theory have been used in structuring the above problem. Let us take a short detour and go over these concepts. 

In graph theory, "edges" and "nodes" (also called "vertices") are fundamental elements that compose a graph. Graphs are used to represent relationships between various entities, and they can take various forms, from simple to complex.

1. Nodes (Vertices):
   - Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of a graph. They are used to represent individual entities or points in a network.
   - Each node typically has a label or identifier to distinguish it from other nodes in the graph.
   - Nodes can represent a wide range of things, such as cities in a transportation network, web pages on the internet, individuals in a social network, or data points in a mathematical graph.

2. Edges:
   - Edges are the connections or links between nodes in a graph. They represent relationships or interactions between the entities represented by the nodes.
   - Each edge usually connects two nodes, and it may have an associated weight or value to signify the strength or cost of the relationship.
   - Edges can be directed (one-way) or undirected (two-way). In a directed graph, the edge has a specific direction from one node to another, while in an undirected graph, the relationship is symmetric, and it doesn't have a direction.

Here are some common types of graphs that utilize nodes and edges:

1. Undirected Graph: In an undirected graph, edges have no direction, and the relationship between nodes is symmetric. If there is an edge between node A and node B, you can travel from A to B or from B to A.

2. Directed Graph (Digraph): In a directed graph, edges have a direction. If there is an edge from node A to node B, you can travel from A to B, but not necessarily from B to A.

3. Weighted Graph: In a weighted graph, each edge has an associated weight or value, which can represent distances, costs, or any relevant measure.

4. Bipartite Graph: A bipartite graph is one in which nodes can be divided into two sets such that all edges connect nodes from one set to the other set, but not within the same set.

5. Tree: A tree is a special type of graph with no cycles. It has a hierarchical structure, and every pair of nodes is connected by a unique path.

6. Network Graph: Network graphs are commonly used in social network analysis and transportation systems. Nodes represent individuals or locations, and edges represent relationships or connections.

The relationships between nodes and edges in a graph can be analyzed and used to solve various problems and model complex systems. In the example problem that we are considering, "edge cut-set" or simply a "cut," refers to a set of edges that, when removed from the graph, partitions the graph into two or more disconnected components. In other words, an edge cut is a collection of edges that, when removed, separates the graph into two or more smaller subgraphs.
The primary purpose of identifying edge cuts in a graph is to understand how the removal of specific edges can impact the connectivity of the graph. Edge cuts are used in various graph algorithms and applications, including network design, connectivity analysis, and flow optimization.
Key points about edge cuts in graphs:
Definition: An edge cut is defined as a set of edges whose removal increases the number of connected components in the graph. In other words, it disconnects the graph.
Minimum Edge Cut: A minimum edge cut, often denoted as "Î»(G)," is the smallest possible set of edges that, when removed, disconnects the graph into two or more components. Finding the minimum edge cut is a common problem in network design and optimization.

# Swarm exploration strategies

[This](https://github.com/jaiisrani/Isoperimetric-Optimization-Algorithms/blob/main/Isoperimetric_Inequalities.ipynb) example generates random points to simulate a swarm in a 2D plane and then uses a greedy algorithm to find an optimal subset of points that minimizes the boundary while covering a significant exploration area. The selected subset of points is highlighted in red in the plot.
